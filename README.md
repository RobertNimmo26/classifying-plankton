# Classifying Plankton

[Deep Learning M (COMPSCI5085)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI5085) Coursework 2023

The aim of the coursework was to design a deep learning architecture to identify plankton species from images. When given a new image of a plankton speciment the model would return to which species it belongs to.

Three models where trained and evaluated. These included a Dense Model, CNN Model, and using the pretrained AlexNet model.
